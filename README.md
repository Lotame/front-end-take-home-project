# Overview
Create an app that visualizes the data from Capital Ride Share (https://gbfs.capitalbikeshare.com/gbfs/gbfs.json). The goal is to show how you can take a user story and implement it using javascript, html, and css.

__*Time Limit: Please spend no more than a couple of hours on this. We respect your time so we do not expect you to spend a lot of time on this. Feel free to add TODO comments about what you would do if you had more time.*__

Most of the boiler plate has been set up for you already. However, this project is only partially reflective of current Lotame front end technology. Our front end uses Backbone, if you are not currently comfortable with Backbone, feel free to rip it out and use what you are comfortable with. 

Our goal is for you to spend a few hours implementing the user story below so we can discuss your code and the choices you made with it in your next interview.

## User Story
As a tourist in Washington D.C., I want to know where I can rent a bike so that I can easily tour the city.

## Acceptance Criteria
Verify that I can
* See how many bikes are available at a station
* See a stations's hours and if it is currently renting bikes
* Sort the stations by region
* Search for a station
* View my station on a map
* See if a station has any electric bikes
* See if a station has any open docks
* See a station's capacity
* Clearly use the page on small and large screens

Include a test plan for how you would validate the acceptance criteria.
