# Overview
Create an app that visualizes the data from Capital Ride Share (https://gbfs.capitalbikeshare.com/gbfs/gbfs.json). The goal is to show how you can take a user story and implement it using javascript, html, and css.

__Time Limit: Please spend no more than a couple of hours on this. We respect your time so we do not expect you to spend a lot of time on this. Feel free to add TODO comments about what you would do if you had more time. __

Most of the boiler plate has been set up for you already. However, this project is only partially reflective of current Lotame front end technology.

## User Story
As a tourist in Washington D.C., I want to know where I can rent a bike so that I can easily tour the city.

## Acceptance Criteria
Verify that I can
* See how many bikes are available at a station
* See a stations's hours and if it is currently renting bikes
* Sort the stations by region
* Search for a station
* View my station on a map
* See if a station has any electric bikes
* See if a station has any open docks
* See a station's capacity
* Clearly use the page on small and large screens

Include a test plan for how you would validate the acceptance criteria.
